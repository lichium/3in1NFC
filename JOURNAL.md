I made an NFC card based on a tutorial, and suddenly thought that multiple cards could be integrated. I tried connecting them in parallel and controlling them with an SP3T switch. There are some warnnings, but I think they don't affect usage. I hope to materialize it and solder, use it.

I made the Readme document and optimized the repository directory.
A little tiring, but I found it really interesting.
Still some work to do on jlc. Wait a minute.

I got the BOM following the tutorial, it was an interesting experience. Now I need to upload this table. It's a bit late, I want to go to sleep zzzzz.
